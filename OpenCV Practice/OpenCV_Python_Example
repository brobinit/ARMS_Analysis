import cv
#imports the functions from opencv so that your program can use them

cv.NamedWindow('a_window', cv.CV_WINDOW_AUTOSIZE)
#creates a window to contain the image. a_window is the identifier, and it is told to autosize

image=cv.LoadImage('picture.png', cv.CV_LOAD_IMAGE_COLOR)
#this function loads the image fromthe same directory. Can be modified to reference folders.
#Second argument is the format of the image when it has been loaded.
#Alternatives: CV_LOAD_IMAGE_GREYSCALE and CV_LOAD_IMAGE_UNCHAINED

font = cv.InitFont(cv.CV_FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, 1, 1, 0, 3, 8)
#font type is created so that opencv can write to the image in a way you specify. Here:
    #First argument: font type cv.CV_FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX
    #vertical scale of the font which affects how tall the text is
    #horizontal scale affects the width of the characters in the text.
    #sheer value to the letters slope(0-1) 1 is 45 degrees from the vertical
    #character thickness (3) makes textbold or not
    #line type (only 3 types supported)

cv.PutText(frame, "Hello World", (5,20),font, 255)
#puttext function adds the text to the frame. arguments consist of:
    #location to be written to (image)
    #text to be written (hello world)
    #coordinates within the image to write the text
    #fron that was proviously initialised
    #color (R,G,B)

cv.ShowImage('a_window', image)
#Displays the image in the window that was initialised at the beginning

cv.WaitKey(10000)
#used here to allow time for the image to be displayed before the program terminates

cv.SaveImage('image.png', image)
#saves a copy of the image with the writing on it. Saves as the specified file name and file type.
